                    </summary>
                    <p> For the course you do not need Spanish. Everybody at our school speak English. To feel
                        comfortable in Barcelona Spanish would help but nowadays in most of the places local people do
                        speak English.</p>

                        place to live. According to the latest survey, the average cost of living for students in
                        Barcelona is around 1000 Euros per month.

                        Expect to spend 300-600€ to rent a room or 600-1000€ for the apartment, around 10€ for a lunch
                        in a restaurant, 10€ for a public transport 10-ride pass.</p>
